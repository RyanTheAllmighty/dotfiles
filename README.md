# dotfiles

My dotfiles.

## Prerequisites

For \*nix systems there are no prerequisites.

For Windows you must be running at least Windows 10 version 1709 (Fall Creators Update).

## Usage

To install these, simply run:

For \*nix systems:

```bash
bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/RyanTheAllmighty/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"
```

For Windows systems run the following from an administrator powershell console:

```powershell
.\install.ps1
```

I've tested this using my own personal rigs which are made up of:

*   Windows 10 Professional
*   Manjaro Linux Gnome Edition
